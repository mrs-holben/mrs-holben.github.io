      <p>
        Our primary focus is to understand God’s purpose for history. His plan is revealed to us through written records.
Starting with the premises that history is the story of God’s plan for man and that history is linear, with Christ and
the cross at the center, the students trace the development of empires, nations, countries, philosophies, movements,
and trends. World history is an overview from the age of exploration to modern times. This course integrates the
humanities—art, literature, music and architecture. Writing skills are utilized as students spend time in historical
research, analyzing primary sources, and communicating a biblical world view of historical events and
interpretations. This course meets the requirements for two credits: 1 history; 1 English
