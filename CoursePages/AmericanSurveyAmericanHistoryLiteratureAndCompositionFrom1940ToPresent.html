      <p>
        The focus of AHLC is to provide a rhetoric-level study of the history of the United States, with an emphasis
      on the humanities. Research, oral communication, and composition are integral components of the course; scored
      discussion, oral discussion and argument are frequent activities. We begin with a review of a biblical worldview as it
      relates to history, first understanding that history is linear, with creation the beginning, heaven the end, and Christ
      the center. We then apply biblical principles to the founding and development of our country, as well as to
      contemporary issues. Of special emphasis is the Creation, Fall, Redemption paradigm as it relates to the
      philosophical decline of the US and to the errors of revisionist history. This course meets the requirements for two
      credits: 1 history; 1 English
