          With gratitude to my godly and faithful parents, I have been actively involved in church all my life. Jesus
          Christ is my Lord and Savior. Additonally, my husband David and I have been married for almost 32
          years. We have one son Henry, a recent graduate of Milligan University. In preparation for teaching, I
          completed undergraduate work at East Tennessee State University. I have lived most of life in East
          Tennessee with the exception of time spent in graduate study abroad, and time spent in mission work
          through Pacific Christian College in Fullerton, Ca. (now known as Hope International University).

          More than half of my thirty (plus) years in education was with a classical Christian school. My strengths
          include teaching composition and literature skills, using classical methodology and developing formal and
          informal debate formats. I also enjoy scored discussions and facilitating Harkness table and Socratic
          seminar discussions with secondary English and history students. Above all else, biblical integration is a
          strength I can share. I truly believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ should be the center of all school subject
          matter. Furthermore, I enjoy writing and developing curriculum using biblical integration. Having taught
          students from sixth grade through college freshman, I have an advantage of knowing where they have
          been and where they need to go.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I enjoy reading, writing, traveling, and gardening with either a piece of chocolate or a cup of tea. I
          hope to enjoy time with you in class.
        </p>
        <p>Professional organizations I belong to include:
        <ul> <li> ACSI </li>
        <li>CELEA</li>
        <li>ILA</li>
        <li>JASNA (For fun)</li>
        <li>NCTE</li></ul></p>
